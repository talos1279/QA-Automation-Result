This is a test result for my interview for Taggle healthworld QA position.

1. The test cases are written in the file under path: //Assets/4.ThirdParties/AltTester/Editor/Scripts/AltTesterEditor/AltTestLogin.cs
2. Each test case starts from the beginning of the app. Please restart the app after every test case.
3. AltTester Desktop needs to be launched before testing.
4. For editor testing, in AltTestLogin.cs, please change the host value to your current wifi IP address. After pressing Play in Editor in AltTester@Editor window, in AltTester popup, you need to change the app name to TestingProject, the host value to your IP address, port gate to 13000. After that, you can run the test case.
5. For android testing, please make sure the device is connected to the same Wifi as your PC. You can install the build I have attached to the email or build it yourself with Build Only in Android tab. After launching the build, you need to change the appname, host value, port gate to the correct value for the test to run. After that, you can activate test case from Unity to run it on device.
